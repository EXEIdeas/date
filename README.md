# Pure JavaScript Date Functions #
These functions are very useful when dealing with any type of date fields.
They use the same format strings as the java.text.SimpleDateFormat class, with a few minor exceptions.

## Functions include: ##

* isDate() - Check if a date is valid
* compareDates() - See if one date is greater than another
* formatDate() - Output a Date() object in any format
* getDateFromFormat() - Parse a date string and return time in ms representing date object
